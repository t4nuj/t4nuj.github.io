<script type="text/javascript">
	console.log("hello world");
	console.log();
	console.log("^ yes it was necessary to do that, or else what kind of a developer would I be. Congratulations. You are now part of the select few who are in on the joke.");

<p>Since a long time, I wanted to start a blog.</p>

<p> It began when I saw Jesse Eisenberg blogging in <em>The Social Network</em>. Portraying a young Zuck, he wrote about his latest "project" and how he "hacked" the Harvard network (we all know how that turned out). Although not as risqu√©, I decided my blog would mostly be a creative outlet about the projects I have built or the books I've read.</p>

<p>But here we are in 2019, and I haven't started one yet.</p>

<p>I took a resolution this year to learn something new each month. Not gonna lie, I haven't lived up to it. But halfway through the year I had a sudden burst of inspiration and decided to restore my personal website. I figured in the process I'd probably learn a few things about what's new in web development and brush up my <em>css-craft</em> and <em>js-fu</em>.</p>

<p>As I began desiging my website, I realized that having an outlet to express myself felt really good. I wanted to document the though process which went into desiging it (more on that later). This lead to a ground-breaking realization: what better way to document it than <em>*gasp*</em> writing a blog.</p>

<p>So here is my very first blog post to commemorate what is hopefully going to be a regular habit. I'll try to blog about my projects, books I found interesting and other general ramblings.</p>
