<p>This year was to be a year of learning and self improvement. I promised myself I would be more reading books and learning new things. Have I done that?</p>

<figure>Well yes, but actually no.</figure>

<p>I started the year on a positive note and finished Stephen Hawking's <em>A Breif History of Time</em>. But as the months progressed, I lost my momentum. I think my problem was I lost interest quickly, since I got short time windows to read. This resulted in a few half read books <em>(Outliers, Thinking Fast & Slow)</em>. I've always been a binge reader since school and college, and was able to find long stretches of time to read. Reading a single chapter at a time is not scaling well with my new lifestyle as a member of the workforce and living independently from my family.</p>


<p>Recently, I had my birthday and got an amazing gift - a hard copy of <em>Deep Learning</em> by xxx. With an ML project at my work in the roadmap and my waning momentum for learning, this couldn't have been timed better. I switched gears to technical learning and spiced things up in the self-improvement department giving my momentum a much needed jolt. By the time my project at work rolls, I will refresh my knowledge in Deep Learning, and get familiarized with new research in Computer Vision + Deep Learning.

<p>As I was working through the prerequisites section (linear algebra, probability, calculus etc.) of the book, I decided to augmented it with other resources. and came across 3Blue1Brown, a maths based youtube channel . It is a treasure trove of very interesting math videos. The foundation of maths series especially is amazing.</p>

<p>xx, the guy behind the channel, makes heavy use of visualizations and animations to explain concepts. e.g. The lessons on vectors & linear transformations (scaling, translating etc.) explain concepts by visually mapping them with animations. I (along with many viewers) found this representation of the concepts very intutive, engaging and memorable. I reccommend readers to check out the lessons and see for themselves how intutive this style of teaching maths can be.</p>

<p>xx has a developed a python library for creating animations, and makes his videos by coding up visuals. On seeing this I had a crazy idea: how about using this library, along with a text2speech engine, to represent lessons as code artifacts. I could use it to start my own YouTube channel, teach Computer Science and earn some $$$. Representing videos this way would eliminate shooting & editing time since I would just be iterating on code. Plus I (probably) can use Morgan Stanley's voice to explain binary trees on my channel.</p>

<figure>Architecture of Video-Lesson as Code</figure>


<p>Although, I currently don't have the time to write content for a channel, the idea to represent video lectures as code artifacts has stuck with me. Imaging a repository where all  lessons are stored, free for anyone to edit or contribute to. Accepting a pull request into this repository triggers a continuous delivery pipeline and publishes video lectures in real time. Now imagine tooling on top of this for aiding non-programmers to generate video lectures.</p>


<p>I want to explore the feasibility of this idea, and if possible implement this too. Making the process to generate high quality content more accessible can help lots of teachers to make more visually engaging lessons. Let's see if I get the time to do it and can actually develop a product here.</p>
