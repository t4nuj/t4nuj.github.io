<p>In March 2015, the Prime Minister's Office of India (PMO India) started a <a href="https://www.google.co.in/landing/pmoapp/" class="tooltip" target="_blank">contest</a> for designing an Android app. It was part of the Digital India initiative and was organized in collaboration with Google.</p>

<p>This contest had 3 phases - ideation, wireframe design, and app implementation.</p>

<p>During the ideation phase, more than 9000 ideas were submitted by people across the country. Based on them, a blueprint of features was released.</p>

<p>From the next 2 phases, the contest required teams for further participation.</p>

<h3>Wireframe Design</h3>
<p>Our team got to know about the contest pretty late. Luckily it was the last 2 weeks of our summer vacation. So we had ample time to prepare and submit the wireframes.</p>

<p>Our wireframes were shortlisted in the <a href="https://blog.mygov.in/pmo-mobile-app-contest-phase-2-shortlisted-top-10-wireframes/" class="tooltip" target="_blank">top 10 entries</a>, and we were invited to pitch our design to the judges.</p>

<p>This app would be used by a diverse set of people. Thus, we decided to address a few themes explicitly in our pitch - support for different languages and accessibility. We also focused heavily on user engagement as the app was planned as part of a more open and transparent governance initiative. And, lastly, we pitched the capabilities and past accomplishments of our team members.</p>

<p>We made the cut again and were shortlisted in the <a href="https://blog.mygov.in/top-5-teams-in-the-pmo-app-contest/" class="tooltip" target="_blank">top 5 teams</a>. (bonus: an extremely embarrasing photo of me)</p>

<h3>App Design</h3>

<p>In the next phase, shortlisted teams were assigned mentors from Google to make the app. A backend had to be implemented as well.</p>

<p>In retrospect, the most significant aspect of this contest was the learning opportunity. With a breadth of features to implement - user forums, payments, streaming audio (SoundCloud), SSO with OAuth, Network APIs - it was bound to enhance my skills.<p>

<p>This was the first time I was forced to think about real-world constraints and resources while building something. We had to think about slow connections, different screen sizes, limited memory on low-end devices, and many more things.</p>

<p> We used the Django in the backend. At the app level, we utilized a variety of libraries and Android system APIs. We interacted with Twitter, SoundCloud, and MyGov APIs to fetch content for the app.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>After months of work, we presented the app to the jury. Sadly, we did not win the contest.</p>

<h4>We Lost ... But</h4>

<p>The experience was terrific. I picked up a lot of new skills:</p>
<ul class="dash less-space normal-font left-margin">
<li>pitching ideas</li>
<li>scaling a codebase</li>
<li>writing code for a resource-constrained system</li>
<li>collaborating with people</li>
<li>interacting with stakeholders</li>
<li>(very) ambigious requirements</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, this was a great experience that I am going to remember throughout my life!</p>
